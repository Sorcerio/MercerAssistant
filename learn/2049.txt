From our broken Terran world to flying future.
Hope in the raining dirt, find that trying future.

Meld with silicon minds like Icarus’s wings.
Here we will not fall from our new shining future.

Set polymers and wires into virgin skin.
Metal chimeras of a linked lurking future.

Colonies will be built in the light of new suns.
Man expands like cluster bombs in raging future.

War will bubble as slick fat on corrupting fire.
Perhaps it will consume all, this raving future.

Or, perhaps, peace may be found through our dispersal.
Difference diffused, product of bloating future.

I, Brody, embrace it all with mind cast open.
For all is experience; a flowing future.
